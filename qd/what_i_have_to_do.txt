Classes

- Predicate
    - Numerical
    - Categorical
- Nodes
    - Branch
    - Leaf
- Query
- Query Clauses
- Data Tuples
- Data Point



Functions

- Predicate
    - Check if query intersects predicate
    - Check if data point in predicate
- Nodes
    - Branch
        - Insert data point into child
    - Leaf
        - Insert data point\
- Query
    - Loop over every leaf node



Algorithms

- QD Tree construction
    - Greedy
        - Make a decision tree, basically
    - RL
        - WOODLBLOCK

Ensure that a query only accesses necessary columns
- file formats: parquet, ORC
- or you can just use a csv cuz this is python anyway

Think about ways to make splitting the data on partitions faster (find papers on this)
- Papers: Autoadmin (UMSR) 2000s, read the partitioning one
